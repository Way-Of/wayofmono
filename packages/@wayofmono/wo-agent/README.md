# @wayofmono/wo-agent

The Agent SDK for building AI-powered applications, including the `wouser` CLI. Designed to be embedded as a standard dependency or used as a general-purpose agent.

## 🚀 Flawless Getting Started

```bash
pnpm add @wayofmono/wo-agent
pnpm exec wouser --init
./wouser
```

## Features

- **Agent SDK**: Create and manage AI agent sessions with ease.
- **wouser CLI**: A user-facing CLI for interacting with agents.
- **Extensible**: Easily add custom tools and extensions.
- **Documentation Expert**: Use `/skill docs` to generate PDF, Word, and Markdown.
- **Visual Synthesis**: Render Mermaid diagrams directly in your terminal.

## 🦙 Prerequisites: Ollama

`wouser` defaults to using **Ollama** for local-first AI. Ensure it is installed and running:
1.  **Install:** `curl -fsSL https://ollama.com/install.sh | sh`
2.  **Pull Model:** `ollama pull qwen3.5:9b`

## 📂 Project Isolation (.wo/)

The `--init` command sets up a project-local `.wo` directory. All session data, configuration (`models.json`), and skills stay inside your project. No global state pollution.
